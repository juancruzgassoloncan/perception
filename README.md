# Perception

This repository is based on the "3D Perception Project for the Robotic Nanodilation Program" available [here](https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-Perception-Project.git) and on the recommended exercises from [here](https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-Perception-Exercises.git).

I am a graduate of the Robotics Nanodrama Program, but this repository was created only for my own experimentation, created from scratch.

## Project Setup

For this setup, catkin_ws is the name of active ROS Workspace, if your workspace name is different, change the commands accordingly If you do not have an active ROS workspace, you can create one by:

$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/
$ catkin_make
Now that you have a workspace, clone or download this repo into the src directory of your workspace:

$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ git clone https://github.com/juancruzgassoloncan/perception.git
